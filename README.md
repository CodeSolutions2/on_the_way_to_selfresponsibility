## Self-resposibility Momentary Guidance Message
"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants" (Isaac Newton). It is important to be responsible for one's own experiences and choices, because it allows one to use technology responsibly and thus 'stand on the shoulders of Giants' such that everyone can advance without conflict.\n
"Have the courage to live your data, be proud of what you do." (anonymous). It is important to be responsible for one's own errors and failures, because errors and faults create disorganization and false information. Taking responsibility for one's life means to fix errors constructively with or without feedback.\n
Using foul mouth/swear words are attractive to use because they make people pay attention to you. They are words that influence people more than other words, such that your opinion can be heard or given more weight, because they are strong emotional words. Using these words occasionally are considered "normal" because people on average have moments where they can not control their emotions, and thus try to control themselves or the situation by swearing. However, using these words on a daily basis signifies that one does not feel like they are in control of their lives, such that others can understand them and respect their wishes. They use foul or mean words to force others to treat them with the respect that they desperately need and desire, instead of setting healthy boundaries with others by telling others how they would like to be treated. By learning to explain clearly and concisely how you would like to be treated in life, to other people and even yourself, allows you to effectively communicate. Taking responsibility for your life is using effective communication, such that one explains one's opinion to others in a calm neutral manner such that the other people can understand without emotional judgement; one's opinion consists of one's perception of events and/or wishes/desires.\n
Long-term thoughtful planning is important to create long-term life structures, like having wealth from job security, health, and a happy family. In order to achieve long-term thoughtful planning, one needs to have a reserve of wealth, health, knowledge, and happiness to be able to continue to create long-term objectives, therefore do not sell or give all of your life/ideas/creations/things. Giving away all of your life/ideas/creations/things only creates poverty because one does not have resources, and thus freedom, to choose a long-term agenda. When one has nothing, one is forced to follow "limited paths" around them to gain more. But, when one has a reserve of resources, one can have more options to follow based on the things that created the resources/wealth, thus allowing for more life options/opportunities/choices. When one has more options/opportunities/choices to follow, one can live a more fulfilled life guided by their own wishes/desires and not a forced life dictated by basic needs. When one follows a path in life, for example a career, one performs work and gains knowledge. The knowledge gained and the work accomplished allows the worker to have more opportunities to continue the career path. This is why it is important to have an education and learn, such that one's hard work will generate better life opportunities than someone who did not take the time and effort to learn. Better life opportunity is the "value of education". Taking responsibility for your life is to keep a reserve of life resources like wealth, health, knowledge, and happiness, by not publicly sharing all of one's information about these topics.\n
Taking responsibility for one's self is to not blaim other people or things for success or non-success.\n
Taking responsibility for one's self is to choose and inform other's about how you would like to be treated. Thus, understanding one's self, one's limits, and being organized such that one is able to tell other people what one needs and/or does not need for their life to be happy, healthy, and successful.\n
When one chooses a career path, one is responsible to learn and participate with the career path. Therefore, in order to be a reliable and responsible participant, one should choose/intend to learn only what they have time to be responsible for based on topic interest. It is responsible to decide if one desires a broad or narrow focused career, with respect to one's available time constraints and interest.  Having a broad focused career generally restricts one from studying topics in-depth, due to not having enough time to study both many different topics and advanced knowledge in a few topics. A career with broad topic focus are likely to work in the capacity as a connector of ideas and/or disciplines, because they would have general to slightly-advanced knowledge about the topics depending on how much time they dedicate to studying/practicing. A career with more narrow topic focus are likely to work as an optimizer and/or creator of ideas/work, where they spend large amounts of time practicing a few topics in-depth such that improvements can be understood and realized.\n
Yelling, changing one's voice, and using derogatory and/or negative words are "command words" that people use to command influence, self-respect, and self-responsibility. Command words cause surprise, and thus influence people to follow what is said. It is responsible to lead a life without the need to use "command words". Effective communication is clearly and concisely explaining a concept (ie: how you would like to be treated) to other people and even yourself, such that the explanation is said in a manner where the other people can understand without emotional judgement/conflict. It is healthy to have an opinion and constructively share opinions about life and topics because one's opinion consists of one's perception of events, experiences, and wishes/desires. Having an opinion is responsible because it is based on knowledge and/or experience, thus it creates more opportunity and thus more life-choice.\n
Not taking resposibility for one's life is to rely on other people for health, wealth, and happiness. For example, expecting that others find you a job or give you good social network contacts so that you can have more life-fortune, without doing any work to create these opportunities, is not taking responibility for one's life. Taking responsibility for your life is to be interested in accomplishing your choosen life goals, and then learn, understand, and take actions to obtain/realize the goals. The opportunities that come to you during or after your hard work will be opportunities that you created. If you are in "good-company", for example have a good social network, you will just find and/or be interested in opportunities from your social-network that are aligned with the work that you are accomplishing. If you are working to accomplish goals you are creating your own opportunities, even if you are following, copying, and/or motivated by someone else. Taking responsibility for your life is to accept that your life-opportunities are created by you, and not someone else that you are inspired by. By taking responsibility for one's life, one will be able to make decisions and have opportunities that are more life-fulfilling, and more aligned with one's short-term and long-term goals.\n 
Taking responsibility for one's life is to accept when one has not accomplished a task, and decide to make a plan to accomplish the task or decide to not participate. Life is always changing and progressing, this includes career knowledge that allows one to stay competent and "up-to-date". It is important to know how to respond to change in a responsible manner, in order to be comfortable and remain interested in one's choosen goals and activities. If one does not learn how to responsibly control one's emotions and perceptions towards change and stress, one could easily turn a beloved career/activity into something that they dislike. It is not responsible to perceive change and learning as a burden, for continued participation in choosen goals or activities. New knowledge and tasks to perform in one's career should be interesting and exciting, because a career is choosen over years/decades of long-term self-investment on learning on a topic. It is not responsible to act pathetic in life or with respect to an activity where knowledge is lacking, such that other people can take responsibility for you or pardon you. For people who do not accept and make reliable decisions during stress and change, it is easy to fall into a pattern of feeling overwhelmed and recount/create "heartbreaking pity stories" or events that influence other people to take responsibility for them or pardon them. Acting pathetic and having "pity stories" surrounding your life only makes one:  more depressed and guilty because they do not accomplish the task and/or say the truth, appear unreliable, appear irresponsible, and appear unaware of how they could have more self-respect and self-responsibility by planning and self-improvement.\n
Taking responsibility for one's life is to have short-term and long-term goals, and have a life-style with long-term thoughtful choices that logically improve the chances for the goals to be realized. One must "train"/practice desired behaviors and actions, such as how one would like to be treated in life, daily such that it is a life-style. If one does not strategically guide one's life with desired goals, behavior, and actions in some manner, one leaves their life to be guided by random events and people around them. A life guided by random events and people around them is a chaotic, reactive, and event-based life where one needs to constantly respond to their environment (ie: "yes, thank you", "no, thank you"). A corrective life-path to a desired long-term goal creates a calmer and more responsible life; participating in event-based environmental-events would be a non-significant part of one's life because one is busy with one's life-path.\n

## 5th topic

Taking responsibility for one's self is to not blaim other people or things for success or non-success.

Taking responsibility for one's self is to choose and inform other's about how you would like to be treated. Thus, understanding one's self, one's limits, and being organized such that one is able to tell other people what one needs and/or does not need for their life to be happy, healthy, and successful.

Taking responsibility for one's self is to know one's limits for risky behavior and responsibility. Taking on too much responsibility by participating in situations where you are held responsible, can give you an unreliable repuation for not completing promises and even prevent you from acheiving your desired short-term and long-term agenda due to inability to physically complete tasked work/situational promises. In my opinion, the practice of gossiping, announcing information about other people, and talking about other people in front of an audience forces the people present to be responsible/connected to the information that was discussed. Similar, to work meetings, everyone included in the room is partially responisble for the information discussed. Thus, in order to be effective, it is good practice to try to avoid being included with situations and information that is not aligned with your short-term and long-term goals, such that you are not obligated to take responsibility for things that you are not interested with and/or have nothing to do with your life.

If you can not make, execute, and receive rewards from decisions and/or actions that you have made and/or done, to have long-term success, you are likely included in situations that do not foster/agree with your life well-being and thinking. In such a situation, it is necessary to take "responsibility for your life" by : [0] evaluating what you would like to happen to you, [1] evaluating how you feel and how you would like to feel about the situation, [2] identify situational aspects that prevent you from obtaining "what you would like to happen" and "how you would like to feel", [3] identify a few changes/improvements to the situational aspects that would allow you to improve your life, [4] tell others in real-life how you would like to be treated with respect to the situational aspects and give your suggestions for improvements and how it would impact/improve your life. You will need to repeat your message of how you would like to be treated, and give constructive feedback to others so that they understand and respect your wishes (ie: human rights) about how you would like to be treated. Do not be discouraged if your life does not immediately improve, be persistent in a calm and logical manner and document small events/improvements as milestones for success and/or improvements to goal planning about the situation.

"Event-based responsive" selection versus "Long-term thoughtful" selection
It is common behavior for people to say "no, I do not want that/it/him/her/them" or "I do not need it/that", for situations that are not desireable. But, these phrases only address and give guidance, for one event at one instance. These phrases are less effective phrases to guide one's life with because they give no short-term or long-term guidance for how one would want to be treated in life with respect to varied situations. "Event-based responsive" selection is responding to the situation with the opinion of the group/environment, with an emotional "yes" or "no" without performing constructive feedback steps 3 and 4 to guide the situation to better align with your short-term/long-term goals (ie: how you would like to be treated with respect to the current situation and similar future situations).

Imagine if you went to an LLM promt and typed "I do not want that", the LLM would not have any information to understand what you want. Instructing/guiding your life is the same as writing a good descriptive LLM prompt or a good concise Internet search keyword phrase into the browser. Short-term goals, long-term goals, acceptable daily-life interactions and behavior are ways to make instructions and guidelines for one's life. Making instruction and guidelines for one's life need to be specific and concise such that you and other's can organize actions and ideas in order to accomplish them. "Long-term thoughtful" selection of things, like concepts/ideas, life-styles, and behaviors, that you want in life means to make and enforce guidelines in response to life-feedback that are aligned with your life-goals. For example, if you apply for a job and receive a lot of negative environmental feedback about your profile/presence, it is thoughtful in a long-term manner be persistant and take responsibility for your life, instead of blaiming, complaining, or being demanding. Again, taking "responsibility for your life" means to have short-term and long-term goals, evaluate the situation, identify improvements to the situation that would allow your goals to be full-filled, execute the improvements and receive feedback. Continue taking "responsibility for your life" until you either get-better/evolve and fit-into the situation, aligned with your goals, and/or you find an environment/group that align with your goals. Taking "responsibility for your life" for the example, is to either try to change your profile to match the environmental feedback or try to find jobs that better match your profile/presence in the environment with less effort and profile change. It is not a certainty that you find a job, however with persistance and continued effort improves the chances of success, because everything that you do to accomplish your goals will allow more improved knowledge and information about the goal/s with respect to what you did, to come to you. In addition, having a "Long-term thoughtful" selection approach to life creates a more peaceful, intelligent, and meaningful life than a "Event-based responsive" emotional approach.
